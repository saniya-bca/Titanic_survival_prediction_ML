# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning classification models. The objective is to analyze the dataset, perform preprocessing, and build predictive models to classify whether a passenger survived or not.

---

## 📊 Problem Statement
Given passenger details such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare, the goal is to predict whether the passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values
- Encoded categorical variables
- Feature selection
- Train-test split

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed survival distribution
- Studied survival patterns based on gender, age, and passenger class
- Visualized key insights using plots

### 3️⃣ Model Building
Implemented and compared:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

### 4️⃣ Model Evaluation
- Accuracy Score
- Classification Report
- Confusion Matrix
- Train vs Test Accuracy Comparison (Overfitting Check)

---

## 📈 Results
The Random Forest model achieved better performance compared to Logistic Regression and provided improved classification accuracy.
